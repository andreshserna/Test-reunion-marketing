## Extra Notes

- **Font Usage:** Jeep typically uses "Helvetica bold" as their font. As a free alternative, I've utilized "Inter" from Google Fonts within the button's font family.
  
- **Button Styling:** For personalized styles and to avoid nesting an HTML `<button>` element inside an `<a>`, I've used anchor tags as buttons.
  
- **Color-hover buttons:** The color scheme is derived from Jeep's styles. I've incorporated a palette of two colors based on their branding.
